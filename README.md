In this project, I set out to build a system that could help identify early signs of mental health issues in adolescent girlsâ€”an age group often overlooked when it comes to emotional well-being. I used a dataset containing responses to mental health-related questions and trained a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to predict whether someone might be at risk. The idea was to turn raw survey data into meaningful predictions that could act as a helpful first step toward seeking support or guidance.
To make the system accessible and easy to use, I created a simple web application using Flask and HTML. Users can enter their responses through an online form, and the system will instantly provide a prediction, such as "You are at low risk" or "You may need mental health support," along with a visual interpretation. This project combined my technical skills with something socially impactful, and it helped me understand how AI can assist in creating compassionate, preventative tools in the mental health space.
